## 🧠 Why Decision Tree?

We chose **Decision Tree** because:  

- **Interpretability**: Decisions are easy to visualize and explain.  
- **Handles mixed data types**: Works with both numerical and categorical features.  
- **No scaling required**: Simplifies preprocessing.  
- **Presentation-friendly**: Decision paths are easy to show in demos or viva.  
- **Feature insights**: Highlights which health parameters influence predictions the most.  

The decision tree allows users to **understand why a prediction was made**, not just the outcome.
